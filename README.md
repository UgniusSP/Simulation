# Simulation
ALU simulation
This code simulates ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit). An arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is a digital circuit used to perform arithmetic and logic operations. 
It represents the fundamental building block of the central processing unit (CPU) of a computer. 
Modern CPUs contain very powerful and complex ALUs. In addition to ALUs, modern CPUs contain a control unit (CU).
